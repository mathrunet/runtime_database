/// When the child's [Scrollable] descendant overscrolls, an animated circular
/// progress indicator is faded into view. When the scroll ends, if the
/// indicator has been dragged far enough for it to become completely opaque,
/// the [onRefresh] callback is called. The callback is expected to update the
/// scrollable's contents and then complete the [Future] it returns. The refresh
/// indicator disappears after the callback's [Future] has completed.
///
/// The trigger mode is configured by [RefreshIndicator.triggerMode].
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// This example shows how [RefreshIndicator] can be triggered in different ways.
///
/// ** See code in examples/api/lib/material/refresh_indicator/refresh_indicator.0.dart **
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// ## Troubleshooting
///
/// ### Refresh indicator does not show up
///
/// The [RefreshIndicator] will appear if its scrollable descendant can be
/// overscrolled, i.e. if the scrollable's content is bigger than its viewport.
/// To ensure that the [RefreshIndicator] will always appear, even if the
/// scrollable's content fits within its viewport, set the scrollable's
/// [Scrollable.physics] property to [AlwaysScrollableScrollPhysics]:
///
/// ```dart
/// ListView(
///   physics: const AlwaysScrollableScrollPhysics(),
///   children: ...
/// )
/// ```
///
/// A [RefreshIndicator] can only be used with a vertical scroll view.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * <https://material.io/design/platform-guidance/android-swipe-to-refresh.html>
///  * [RefreshIndicatorState], can be used to programmatically show the refresh indicator.
///  * [RefreshProgressIndicator], widget used by [RefreshIndicator] to show
///    the inner circular progress spinner during refreshes.
///  * [CupertinoSliverRefreshControl], an iOS equivalent of the pull-to-refresh pattern.
///    Must be used as a sliver inside a [CustomScrollView] instead of wrapping
///    around a [ScrollView] because it's a part of the scrollable instead of
///    being overlaid on top of it.
